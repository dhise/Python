#Thought of this while brushing my teeth immediately after making the first one. Instead of actually having the pc choose Rock paper or scissors it's just a roll
#- of the dice to determine if you win, draw, or lose. The only thing is I'm not sure how I can get it to respond with what it chose since technically
#- it isn't choosing anything here. 

import random
import time
#Rock = 1 Scissors = 2 Paper = 3

            print(f'You chose {player_guess}')
            time.sleep(2)
